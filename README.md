# Final Capstone Project Proposal


## What are you trying to do?
<i>Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon (i.e. as if you were explaining to a salesperson, executive, or recruiter). Again, this should be a description of a real world problem, not an algorithm you aspire to use.</i>

### Option A: Interior Layout Generator  
### Option B: Brand/Logo Recognizer
### Option C: Buyout/Merger/Aquisition Activity Predictor 
### Option D: Motorcycle Recognizer
### Option E: Handwriting Analysis/ Graphology 


## How has this problem been solved before?
<i>If you feel like you are addressing a novel issue, what similar problems have been solved, and how are you borrowing from those? Note, at this point you should be citing papers, medium articles, or other sources from the data science community. You should have links to your research in your proposal document and cite previous work.</i>

## What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?
<i> It's OK to be working on a problem that has been worked on before, but you do need to do need to have some novel contribution to the project.</i>

## Who cares? If you're successful, what will the impact be?
<i>It is preferable to be asked 'Who cares' now then when you're telling someone about your project. Not every project needs to change the world, but project whose appeal is very niche might not be the best way to spend your time and energy.</i>

## How will you present your work?
<i>Again, be ambitious in your proposals, but think about what is the most impactful way your project could exist.</i>

## What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?
<i> You should no longer be analyzing csv files. Is the amount of data you have limiting the ways you can approach the problem? Would you have a different approach if you could collect more? Same as last capstone, you should have all of your data on day one. </i>

## What are potential problems with your capstone?
<i>More importantly, what is your plan to mitigate these problems? Again, being aware of previous solutions to similar problems gives you a template for successfully working with data of this type.</i>

## What is the next thing you need to work on?
<i>Getting the data, not just some, likely all? Understanding the data? Building a minimum viable product? Gauging how much signal might be in the data? </i>
