# Final Capstone Project Proposal


## What are you trying to do?
<b><u>Floorplan Layout Generator</u></b>

“Computers are not good at open-ended creative solutions; that’s still reserved for humans. But through automation, we’re able to save time doing repetitive tasks, and we can reinvest that time in design.”—Mike Mendelson

I plan to build and construct an automatic floorplan image analysis tool and/or a classification tool to classify the type of area/room within a layout and provide the percent that the area/room takes of the whole floor/space.

## How has this problem been solved before?
Architecture's use of automation is on the rise. For instance, a company named [Finch](https://finch3d.com/) has built an algorithm which "generates different spatial configurations according to predetermined parameters as you change the total area of the space." [1] Another company HighArc is using machine learning to automate exterior home design. [2]

A graduate of Harvard University's School of Design has done a lot of interesting work and reporting on the convergence of machine learning and architectural design.[5]
Specifically, two of his projects aim to  "(1) generate floor plans i.e. optimize the generation of a large and highly diverse quantity of floor plan designs, (2) qualify floor plans i.e. offer a proper classification methodology" [3]

I think this has the best application to the work done in this DSI course thus far. 

## What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?
## Who cares? If you're successful, what will the impact be?

Given Chaillou's work, I am not sure I have much to contribute. However, I do see this potentially playing a part in how houses are remodeled where the requirement of some spaces needing to stay can be restrictive on any new design. I also see this having an impact in a commerical environment where an entire office floor can be designed by the tool. It could further be used for parks/playgrounds, backyards, etc... 

Currently, I plan to get a firm grasp on mastering the interior floorplans of residential enviornments before moving onto the other possibiliies. 

## How will you present your work?

Here, the visuals will be the best storyteller. I propose to likely generate a site via https://pages.github.com/ which will allow for the mix of models, images, and storytelling. 

## What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?
A few options/resources have popped up in an initial search:

<b>CubiCasa5k</b><br>
https://zenodo.org/record/2613548#.XkrWShNKhTZ <br>
contains 5000 samples annotated into over 80 floorplan object catagories. 

<b>ROBIN (Repository Of BuildIng plaNs)</b> <br>
https://github.com/gesstalt/ROBIN <br>
170 - three bedroom floorplans<br>
170 - four bedroom floorplans<br>
170 - five bedroom floorplans

<b> SESYD "Systems Evaluation SYnthetic Documents</b><br>
http://mathieu.delalandre.free.fr/projects/sesyd/symbols/floorplans.html<br>
1000 images of various floorplans 


## What are potential problems with your capstone?
## What is the next thing you need to work on?

Potential problems include Figuring out which data set to use and mastering image recognition through the use of neural networks. 
I plan to mitigate this by doing a lot of EDA into the data sets to decide ahead of time. 
In terms of beefing up my neural network/machine learning skills, I plan on scheduling time with my instructors outside of class as well as utilizing online resources to ensure a deep understanding of the tools.
